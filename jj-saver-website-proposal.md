# JJ Saver Co - Website Proposal

## About The Business

**JJ Saver Co** - Family-run Fremantle furniture store since 1991
**Location:** Heart of Fremantle, WA
**What they do:** Quality secondhand & ex-display furniture, white goods, clearance items
**Tagline:** "You Can Always Find a Bargain!"

### Why They Need a New Website

Their current site (jjsaverco.com.au) is stuck in the early 2010s:
- Dated design that doesn't reflect their friendly, trusted reputation
- No way to browse current stock online
- No online enquiries or reservations
- Doesn't showcase their amazing Google reviews (4.8+ stars!)
- Missing the "family business" warmth that customers love

### Their Strengths (from Google Reviews)
- "Delivered next day with a smile and a few jokes"
- "95-year-old mother has been shopping here for many years"
- "Bought a washing machine 20 years ago and it's still working"
- "Pay almost half for furniture that's almost new"
- Responsive owner who replies to every review personally

## The Pitch (Friendly Approach)

### Opening
> "G'day! I'm [Name], I live locally in the western suburbs. I've walked past your store heaps of times and finally popped in recently - love the vibe, proper old-school Freo business.
>
> I noticed your website doesn't really show off how great you guys are. Your Google reviews are fantastic - 'bought a washing machine 20 years ago and it's still working' - that's amazing! But your website looks like it's from 2010.
>
> I build websites for local businesses. Nothing fancy, just clean modern sites that actually help bring customers in. Would you be interested in having a chat about updating yours?"

### Handling Objections

**"We're too busy / don't have time"**
> "That's exactly why you need a better site! Imagine if customers could browse what you have online before coming in, or send an enquiry at 9pm when you're closed. Less tyre-kickers, more serious buyers."

**"We get enough business already"**
> "That's great! But what about all the people searching 'secondhand furniture Fremantle' on Google right now who end up at your competitors because their sites look more professional? You've got 30+ years of trust - let's show it off."

**"We don't understand technology"**
> "You don't need to! I handle everything. You just tell me what you want to say about your business, send me some photos, and I do the rest. If you can send an email, you can update the site."

**"It's too expensive"**
> "I totally understand. Here's the thing - one extra furniture sale probably covers the cost of the whole website. And unlike the Yellow Pages, this works 24/7 forever. Plus my ongoing fee is less than a coffee a day."

**"Can't we just use Facebook?"**
> "Facebook's great for regulars, but when someone Googles 'furniture store Fremantle', your Facebook page won't show up well. A proper website ranks on Google and looks more professional. Most people check both - Facebook for personality, website for legitimacy."

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | What Happens |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **1. Discovery** | 1-2 days | Meet, discuss their needs, gather content |
| **2. Design** | 3-5 days | Create mockup for approval |
| **3. Build** | 5-7 days | Develop the actual site |
| **4. Review** | 2-3 days | Their feedback, adjustments |
| **5. Launch** | 1 day | Go live, test everything |

**Total: 2-3 weeks** (can be faster if they're responsive)

## Value Proposition

### The Math That Sells It

**Current Situation:**
- Customers can't see stock online
- Can't capture enquiries after hours
- Website looks dated = perception of dated business
- Missing customers who search online first

**After New Website:**
- Average furniture sale: $300-800
- If website brings in just 2 extra sales/month = $600-1,600/month
- Website cost: $750 (Option A)
- **Pays for itself in 1-2 months**

### Their Reviews Prove the Opportunity

These reviews mention:
- "Stop shopping around furniture shops try JJ first" - customers WANT to recommend them
- "Pay almost half for furniture that's almost new" - great value proposition
- Next-day delivery, assembly included, friendly service

**All of this should be on the homepage, front and centre!**

---

## Next Steps

1. **Drop by the store** - casual visit, buy something small, start a conversation
2. **Mention the website casually** - "I noticed your website could use some love"
3. **Offer to show them a mockup** - "I'd love to put together a quick demo for you, no obligation"
4. **Build a simple mockup** - 1-2 hours in Figma or even just screenshots
5. **Present in person** - show them how much better it could look
6. **Close the deal** - start with Option A, mention Option B as future upgrade

---

## Notes

- They respond to EVERY Google review personally - they care about customers
- "JJ" in the name suggests the owner's initials - personal touch
- Been there since 1991 = 33+ years of trust to leverage
- The "Massive Storewide Sale" banners suggest they understand marketing
- Next door to "Home Staging Trade Supply & Swap" - potential second client?
